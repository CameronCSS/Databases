## Database vs Data lake vs Data warehouse
### Database
- A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

### Data Lake
- A data lake is a vast and flexible storage repository that can hold both structured and unstructured data at any scale. Unlike databases, data lakes do not enforce a predefined schema, allowing data to be ingested in its raw form.

### Data Warehouse
- A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes of historical and structured data from different sources. The data in a data warehouse is organized to support business intelligence, reporting, and data analysis. Unlike databases that are optimized for transactional processing, data warehouses are optimized for analytical processing and complex queries.
